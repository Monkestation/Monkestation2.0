	name: The Syndicate
	desc: Misc syndi propaganda
Central Command eats babies. It's true! Do your own research.
Join the Syndicate! Limited positions open! If you don't I'm sure your friends will!
Try Nanotreason today!
Nanotrasen, hiring only the most incompetent security since 1995!
There is no escape from the Syndicate. Surrender is your only chance of salvation.
Do you really think Nanotrasen would send their best and brightest to work on a hunk of scrap so far from Sol?
It's honestly pathetic that you don't realize just how dead you are.
Are you really willing to risk your life for some mediocre tech company?
Do you feel safe sealed inside a box full of mentally unstable and underqualified lunatics?
Nanotrasen ought to spend more on training, this is just embarrassing.
The Syndicate knows who you are, where you come from and we +will+ know where you go.
We see everything.
What kind of corporation attaches a self destruct device to their workplaces?
The souls of those who serve the beast of Nanotrasen are forfeit in the eyes of the gods.
After 6 centuries of clawing to the top, there are few atrocities which Nanotrasen has +not+ commited.
You can pledge your life to Nanotrasen, but you'll always be second choice to your boss' clone.
In space nobody can hear you "help maint"
Nanotrasen may be ready to clone you no matter how we kill you. But they don't extend that to your family.
Now that Nanotrasen has your soul under lock and key, we are your +only+ hope of salvation.
You may be be very good at keeping secrets from CentCom. But our eyes see much, +much+ more than they do.
The only person you're making a fortune for working in the Spinward Sector is your boss' boss.
The Nanotrasen banner hangs without shame over countless butchered planets.
Nanotrasen has no interest in a better galaxy or humanity. All it desires is to devour life for a tidy profit.
Why would a corporation which values worker safety not give them their strongest forms of self-defense?
Watch the shadows, because they're watching you.
TerraGov had to refit the whole Sol waste disposal system just to handle the volume of crap said by NT Reps.
