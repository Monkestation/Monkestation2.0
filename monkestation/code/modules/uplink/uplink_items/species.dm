			these little guys have been brainwashed and taught how to undo virtually all kinds of clothing and equipment \
			along with how to disarm people. We sadly couldn't figure out how to teach them friend from foe so just be careful \
			handling them, as they wont hesitate to pants you and the captain at the same time."
