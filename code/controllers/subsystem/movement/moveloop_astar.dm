/**
 * Used for following A* defined paths. The proc signature here's a bit long, I'm sorry
 *
 * Returns TRUE if the loop sucessfully started, or FALSE if it failed
 *
 * Arguments:
 * moving - The atom we want to move
 * chasing - The atom we want to move towards
 * delay - How many deci-seconds to wait between fires. Defaults to the lowest value, 0.1
 * repath_delay - How often we're allowed to recalculate our path
 * max_path_length - The maximum number of steps we can take in a given path to search (default: 30, 0 = infinite)
 * miminum_distance - Minimum distance to the target before path returns, could be used to get near a target, but not right to it - for an AI mob with a gun, for example
 * access - A list representing what access we have and what doors we can open
 * simulated_only -  Whether we consider turfs without atmos simulation (AKA do we want to ignore space)
 * avoid - If we want to avoid a specific turf, like if we're a mulebot who already got blocked by some turf
 * skip_first -  Whether or not to delete the first item in the path. This would be done because the first item is the starting tile, which can break things
 * timeout - Time in deci-seconds until the moveloop self expires. Defaults to infinity
 * subsystem - The movement subsystem to use. Defaults to SSmovement. Only one loop can exist for any one subsystem
 * priority - Defines how different move loops override each other. Lower numbers beat higher numbers, equal defaults to what currently exists. Defaults to MOVEMENT_DEFAULT_PRIORITY
 * flags - Set of bitflags that effect move loop behavior in some way. Check _DEFINES/movement.dm
