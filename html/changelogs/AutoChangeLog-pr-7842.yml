  - rscadd: "Slashers gain a new \"Recall Traps\" ability to recall beartraps not in their belt, or recreate destroyed ones. Recalling removes traps attached to victims."

  - balance: "Slasher belt can now only hold a maximum of 3 beartraps."
  - bugfix: "Slasher objectives (instructions) now display properly and no longer fill up chat multiple times."
