changes:
  - balance: "The heresy phobia from being sacrificed is now deep-rooted rather than permanent, meaning that it can be cured with a lobotomy."
  - balance: "Victims in stamina crit are now also eligible for the heretic sacrifice rune."
  - qol: "Heretic influences take longer to fade in (15 seconds -> 1 minute), and disappear after 10 minutes."
  - qol: "Heretic sacrifices will now try to grab a corpse's ghost when trying to revive."
  - bugfix: "Touching a tear in reality while being immune to dismemberment will just result in the arm being terribly wounded instead, avoiding a bug with the limb still being \"there\" despite being deleted."
  - balance: "The Codex Cicatrix is now fully acid and fire-proof."
  - balance: "Heretic armor and the void cloak are now fully acid and fire-proof."
  - qol: "The beginning of the heretic sacrifice minigame will nullify any sorts of pre-existing stuns or sleeps, and prevent several external factors such as heart/liver problems, phobias, sedatives, epilepsy, or brain tumors from causing issues during the minigame."
  - balance: "Ash heretics will no longer succumb to infections from burn wounds. The wound itself still remains an issue, it just won't get infected."
