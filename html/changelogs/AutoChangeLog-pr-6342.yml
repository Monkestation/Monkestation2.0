  - rscadd: "Slasher will now spawn in maints as spooky jesus intended."
  - rscadd: "Slasher now has a jaunt that goes through windows and doors but not walls. It is a NON-MAGICAL jaunt - 4s duration, 2minute cooldown, and leaves a trail of blood behind it."
  - rscdel: "Removed slasher's invisibility, he is now always just slightly invisible."
  - rscdel: "Removed slasher's machete damage and throw damage scaling on light level."
  - bugfix: "Hopefully fixed the Slasher's tracking circle (for the fifth time). Currently, targets with unknown identity cannot be chosen as it was causing issues with the slasher's tracker."
  - sound: "Slasher now has new SFX for jaunting."
  - image: "Slasher now has all new icons for his outfit and jaunt."
  - code_imp: "Cleaned up some of Slasher's code."
