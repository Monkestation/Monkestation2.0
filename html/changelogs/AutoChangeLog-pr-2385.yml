  - balance: "(carlarctg) Reduced the complexity cost of a lot of MODules: Pathfinder 2 -> 1, Tether 3 -> 2, Temperature Regulator 2 -> 1, DNA lock 2 -> 1, Health analyzer 2 -> 1, Sonar 2 -> 1, Microwave beam 2 -> 1, Drill 2 -> 1, All visors (including NV and thermals) 2 -> 1, Circuit Adapter 2 -> 1"
  - balance: "(carlarctg) The Mining MODsuit has had its complexity increased to 13 and now starts with the eating apparatus module, with a total base complexity of 10/13 now."
  - balance: "(carlarctg) The Prototype MODsuit's active slowdown has been decreased from 1.5 (!) to 1."
  - spellcheck: "(carlarctg) Fixed a type on the energy net module."
  - rscadd: "(Hatterhat) A really old data disk with the MOD module designs for the status readout was recovered, and has been haphazardly hotpatched into the research networks."
  - rscadd: "(Hatterhat) Also, the status readout module now plays a sound on death."
  - qol: "(Hatterhat) The MODsuit health analyzer's info tab health readout can now be disabled in its settings."
  - rscadd: "(Melbert) The Atrocinator will now flip you even more."
  - qol: "(StaringGasMask) Now plasmamen can use the infiltrator MODsuit without having their species revealed. The helmet's still not sealed, so remember your mask."
  - qol: "(Hatterhat) When a MOD fails to store something in itself when retracting, you're now notified in both the chat and by a balloon alert."
  - qol: "(Momo8289) You can now use any hat with the hat stabilizer MOD."
  - bugfix: "(Momo8289) The MOD eating apparatus module now properly disables pepper spray protection."
