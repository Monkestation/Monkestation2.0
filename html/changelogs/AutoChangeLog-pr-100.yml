  - rscadd: "Added many new AI modules, Crewsimov Lawset and module and modules for SyndOS 3.1, and Crewsimov++, along with both Crewsimov and Crewsimov++ modules being mapped into the AI Uploads of each and every map just in case any of the heads need any of said modules to bring the AI back to a normal lawset to help the crew of any species and not just forced to use Asimov or Asimov++ to change the AI to a normal lawset that mainly focuses on serving human crew, brings back the Freeform Core AI Module, made a syndicate weaponized AI Module lootdrop spawner that's only on the nukie base for nukies to possibly maybe use whenever they spawn (since on Monke Dynamic they are pretty rare anyways and such) along with some many new zeroth law AI Modules from station sided ones like \"Delta Emergency\" and \"Code Red Emergency Zeroth Law\" to very dangerous and chaotic ones like \"GodlySubject\"."
