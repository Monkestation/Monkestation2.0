  - bugfix: "(GoldenAlpharex) Makes checks for the station z level more robust against coders doing less intuitive stuff, thus protecting it from breaking in weirdly difficult and seemingly unrelated places (I'm looking at you, nuke cinematic unit test)."
  - code_imp: "(timothymtorres) Add multi-z helper function."
