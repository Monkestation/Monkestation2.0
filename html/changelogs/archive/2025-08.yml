      come out weird.

      painter.

  - rscadd: Added toy variants of three different heretic blades Flesh-Like, Metallic,
      and Rustic which all can steal hats. They are all available in the Donksoft
      Toy Vendor and have their own crafting recipes under melee weapons.

  - rscdel: Removed brotherly connections pop up on inspecting
  Wisemonster:
  - rscadd: Automated announcement systems now announce researched nodes to their
      respective departments. You can stop this by either disabling the announcement
      systems or by using a multitool on the circuitboard of the console you're researching
      nodes from.
