  Absolucy:
  - balance: Burning yellow extracts no longer electrocute and deal damage, instead
      they cause painful disorientation for a few seconds.
  - balance: Burning metal extracts now just applies and ignites thermite to adjacent
      walls, instead of instantly deleting them.
  - rscadd: Blood Brothers is no longer a conversion antag.
  - rscdel: Midround BBs are gone, mostly because I have no clue how to make those
      work properly midround when you need at least 2 people to sign up.

      BBs, for variety's sake.
  Absolucy, Mothblocks:
  - balance: Instead of too much damage to the head beheading someone, it will now
      split their skull in half. While their skull is open, you can rip out their
      eyes with your hands. and they will spill their brain out of their head if they
      slip. Zombies can still be beheaded, though.
  - rscadd: You can right click on a dead body using a sharp weapon while targeting
      their head to decapitate them after a short delay, though. More powerful weapons
      do this quicker - a double-bladed energy sword is faster than a normal energy
      sword, which itself is still faster than a circular saw.
  - balance: The Path of Blades ascension will accept either a beheaded person, or
      someone with their skull split open.
