  Absolucy:

  - balance: Instead of too much damage to the head beheading someone, it will now
      split their skull in half. While their skull is open, you can rip out their

      slip. Zombies can still be beheaded, though.
  - rscadd: You can right click on a dead body using a sharp weapon while targeting
      their head to decapitate them after a short delay, though. More powerful weapons
