changes:
  - rscadd: "Added the Hard of Hearing trait which makes everything sound quieter, this is caused by mild ear damage, stronger ear damage still causes complete deafness."
  - rscadd: "Added the Hard of Hearing Quirk which causes everyone to sound like they are whispering."
  - bugfix: "Fixed an issue where the ears being damaged multiple times in one tick can cause deafness to last much longer than intended."
