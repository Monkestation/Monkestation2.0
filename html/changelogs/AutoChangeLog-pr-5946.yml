  - rscadd: "The Recolorable Turtleneck loadout item is now available to all! You can find it in the \"Misc. Under\" section of the store for 3000 Monkecoin. Donators are unaffected by this change and still receive a Recolorable Turtleneck for free (though you can purchase the item anyways if you want two Recolorable Turtlenecks in your inventory)."
