changes:
  - bugfix: "Fixes conservation of energy issues relating to charging powercells."
  - qol: "APCs will display how much power they are using to charge their cell. This is accounted for in the power monitoring console."
  - qol: "All arbitrary power cell energy units you see are replaced with prefixed joules."
  - balance: "As a consequence of the conservation of energy issues getting fixed, the power consumption for charging cells is now very significant."
  - balance: "APCs only use surplus power from the grid after every machine processes when charging, preventing APCs from causing others to discharge while charging."
  - balance: "Engineering SMES start at max charge to combat the increased energy loss due to conservation of energy fixes."
  - code_imp: "Cleans up some of the laser energy cost code"
  - qol: "NTNet Downloader now has a search bar, and programs are now better sorted."
  - rscadd: "PDAs with a dead power cell are now limited to using their Messenger app."
  - bugfix: "Microwaves now stop charging PDAs if the cell was removed mid-charge."
  - bugfix: "Microwaves can now charge laptops."
  - bugfix: "PDA Flashlights can't be turned on while the PDA is dead."
  - bugfix: "You can now hold a laptop up to a camera (if it has a notekeeper app installed) like PDAs already could."
  - balance: "Drastically reduces the power consumption and max charge of power cells"
  - balance: "Added a new stock part called the battery, used primarily in the construction of APCs and SMESs."
  - rscadd: "Suiciding with a cell/battery will shock you and potentially dust you/shock the people around you if the charge is great enough."
